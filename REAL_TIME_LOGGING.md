# Real-Time Test Status Logging Feature

## Overview

Jest Parallel Worker now includes comprehensive real-time test status logging that provides live updates of test progress, both in the console output and detailed log files.

## Features Added

### 1. **Real-Time Console Status Updates**

During test execution, you'll see live status updates in the console:

```
[INITIALIZED] Tests: 0/13 (0%) | ✓ 0 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running
[PROGRESS]    Tests: 3/13 (23%) | ✓ 3 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 10 running  
[PROGRESS]    Tests: 13/13 (100%) | ✓ 13 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running
[FINAL]       Tests: 13/13 (100%) | ✓ 13 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running
```

### 2. **Intelligent Status Color Coding**

- **Green info messages** when all tests are passing
- **Yellow warning messages** when failures are detected
- **Automatic failure highlighting** in real-time

### 3. **Detailed Log File Tracking**

All status updates are written to `logs/jest-parallel-runner.log` with detailed metrics:

```
[TEST-STATUS] INITIALIZED: Tests: 0/13 (0%) | ✓ 0 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running
[TEST-STATUS] PROGRESS: Tests: 3/13 (23%) | ✓ 3 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 10 running
[TEST-METRICS] Success Rate: 100.0% | Completion: 23% | Throughput: 3 tests completed
[TEST-SUMMARY] Final Results: 13 total tests | 13 passed | 0 failed | 0 skipped | Success Rate: 100.0%
[TEST-SUMMARY] All 13 tests passed successfully!
```

### 4. **Performance Metrics**

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of tests passing
- **Completion Rate**: Overall progress percentage  
- **Throughput**: Number of tests completed
- **Real-time failure warnings**

## Status Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✓ | **Passed tests** |
| ✗ | **Failed tests** |
| ○ | **Skipped tests** |
| ⟳ | **Currently running tests** |

## Example Output

### Successful Run
```bash
[INITIALIZED] Tests: 0/10 (0%) | ✓ 0 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running
[PROGRESS]    Tests: 5/10 (50%) | ✓ 5 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 5 running
[FINAL]       Tests: 10/10 (100%) | ✓ 10 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running

Final Results: 10 total tests | 10 passed | 0 failed | 0 skipped | Success Rate: 100.0%
All 10 tests passed successfully!
```

### Run with Failures
```bash
[INITIALIZED] Tests: 0/8 (0%) | ✓ 0 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running
[PROGRESS]    Tests: 3/8 (38%) | ✓ 3 passed | ✗ 0 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 5 running
[PROGRESS]    Tests: 8/8 (100%) | ✓ 5 passed | ✗ 3 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running  ⚠️
[FINAL]       Tests: 8/8 (100%) | ✓ 5 passed | ✗ 3 failed | ○ 0 skipped | ⟳ 0 running  ⚠️

Final Results: 8 total tests | 5 passed | 3 failed | 0 skipped | Success Rate: 62.5%
3 test(s) failed - check individual test results for details
```

## Technical Implementation

### Status Tracking
- **Initialization**: Sets up total test count from parsed files
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates counters as worker results come in
- **Throttled Logging**: Updates every 1 second to avoid log spam
- **Final Summary**: Comprehensive completion statistics

### Log Categories
- `[TEST-STATUS]`: Real-time status updates
- `[TEST-METRICS]`: Performance and completion metrics  
- `[TEST-SUMMARY]`: Final results and warnings

### Integration
- **All execution modes**: native-parallel, jest-parallel, parallel-file, parallel-test
- **Automatic cleanup**: Proper resource management
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of worker failures
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal performance impact

## Benefits

1. **✅ Real-time visibility** into test execution progress
2. **✅ Early failure detection** - see failures as they happen
3. **✅ Performance monitoring** - track success rates and throughput
4. **✅ Detailed logging** - comprehensive execution history
5. **✅ Better debugging** - understand test execution patterns
6. **✅ CI/CD friendly** - clear progress indicators for automated builds

## Usage

The real-time logging is **automatically enabled** in all execution modes:

```bash
# All modes now include real-time status logging
npm run test:native-parallel
npm run test:jest-parallel  
npm run test:examples
npm run test:file-level
```

No configuration needed - the feature works out of the box!

## Log File Location

Detailed logs are written to:
```
logs/jest-parallel-runner.log
```

You can tail this file during execution to see detailed status updates:
```bash
tail -f logs/jest-parallel-runner.log
```
